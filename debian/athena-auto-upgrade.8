.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR athena-auto-upgrade
is intended to be run by cron on a regular basis.  It queries Hesiod
for the newest release of Ubuntu, and then kexec's into the installer
for that version. If the upgrade fails prior to kexec, a message will
be sent to the \fIuser\fP syslog facility, with priority \fInotice\fP.

You really don't want to run this by hand.
