.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR athena-auto-update
is intended to be run by cron on a regular basis.  It attempts to
reconfigure any unconfigured packages, then will simulate an upgrade.
If there are no packages to update, it will exit.  If there are
packages to update, it will ensure that the update process won't try
to remove any of the required metapackages.  It will then perform the
upgrade, and update the apt-file cache.

If the update fails at any point, a message will be sent to the
\fIuser\fP syslog facility, with priority \fInotice\fP.

The results of the script are logged to \fI/var/log/athena-update\fP.
